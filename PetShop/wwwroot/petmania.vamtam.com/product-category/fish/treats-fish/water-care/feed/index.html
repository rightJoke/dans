					<description><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION

Tetra Water Clarifier clears cloudy aquarium water caused by overfeeding, gravel dust and other minute suspended particles. This phosphate-free liquid solution is safe to use in all freshwater aquariums. This effective formula works by causing small, suspended particles to quickly clump together. These larger particles are then removed during normal power filter operation. This formula is based on clarifiers used to treat drinking water. It's safe to use with fish and plants and will not affect water pH levels in your aquarium.

Features:

FOR FRESHWATER AQUARIUMS: Quickly clears cloudy or hazy water caused by overfeeding, gravel dust and other minute suspended particles.
CLUMPING ACTION: Causes small, suspended particles to quickly clump together to settle or be removed during normal power filter operation.
SAFE FOR PLANTS &#38; ORNAMENTAL FISH: When used as directed - will not affect water pH levels.
WORKS ON SOFT WATER: Safe for fish even in very soft water (low kH) conditions.
USAGE: 1 teaspoon treats 10 gallons of water.

Includes: (1) 8.4 oz bottle

Intended Pet(s): Fish

Color: Yellow

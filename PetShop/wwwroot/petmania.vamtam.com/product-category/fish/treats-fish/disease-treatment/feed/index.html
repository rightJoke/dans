					<description><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION
Maintaining a healthy, safe aquarium environment for your fish is important, and regularly testing your water levels is critical to success. Tetra Easy Strips Test Strips are the perfect solution. By quickly testing for all water-quality issues in your aquarium water, these strips provide accurate results with minimal effort, using the most advanced technology in water testing. Many factors can affect the water in your aquarium - including the source of your water (municipal vs. spring water), the food you feed your fish, the amount of algae growing and much more. Tetra Easy Strips are accurate, fast and easy to use. Just dip quickly in your aquarium water, wait 60 seconds and get readings on chlorine, alkalinity, nitrite, water hardness, nitrate and pH level for complete, all-in-one testing. Use the color chart (included) to interpret your test results and determine how best to manage your aquariumâs water quality. Use weekly in both freshwater and saltwater tanks.
